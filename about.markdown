## About me

My name is Johanna Larsson and I'm a software developer with an obsession for programming languages. This has led me to spend quite some time trying a lot of them out. The way I see it is that each one widens your understanding by showing a problem and solution from a slightly different perspective. Some of the ones that have had the strongest impact on me are Haskell, Clojure, Python, as well as books such as [The Little Schemer][tls].

This blog features everything from opinionated articles on development practices to basic write ups of small time projects in whatever technologies I got worked up about at the moment. There is often a serious lack of material on the step just between learning a language and being able to build advanced applications in it, and that's one of the areas I'll be aiming for in my posts. The source code for this site is [available for reference on github][variadicgh].

Feel free to contact me at <johanna@variadic.me>. I enjoy emails. And cats.
